Checkers is a classic board game that is played on an 8x8 board with 64 squares of alternating
colors, red and yellow in this game. The game is played between two players, who each have
12 pieces in their respective colors, either white or black, arranged on opposite sides of the
board.

The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or to block them so they
cannot make any more moves.

The rules of checkers are as follows:
nl
Players take turns moving one piece diagonally forward on the dark squares.

Normal pieces can only move forward, but if they reach the last row on the opposite side of the 
board, they can be promoted to a king, which can move diagonally in any direction.

Captures are made by jumping over an opponent's piece that is adjacent and landing on an
empty square. Multiple jumps are allowed in one turn.

If there is a choice between multiple captures, the player can choose which one to make.

The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them so they cannot
make any more moves.

location and culture where it is played.
